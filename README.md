Introduction
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for e-commerce businesses aiming to enhance sales and improve customer satisfaction. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing patterns, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, personalize recommendations, and optimize inventory management. This project utilizes K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to identify distinct customer segments within an e-commerce dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises customer transaction data collected from a well-known e-commerce platform over a specific period. The data includes information such as customer ID, transaction dates, purchase amounts, and product categories. Prior to analysis, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize numerical features.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming raw data to ensure its suitability for clustering analysis. Key steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing data to maintain dataset integrity.

Normalization: Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity, which is essential for distance-based algorithms like K-Means.

Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features that contribute significantly to customer segmentation.

K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering partitions customers into distinct groups based on feature similarity. The algorithm follows these steps:

Initialization: Select K initial cluster centroids randomly.

Assignment: Assign each customer to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance.

Update: Recalculate centroids by computing the mean of customers assigned to each cluster.

Iteration: Repeat the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize.

The optimal number of clusters (K) is determined using the silhouette score, which measures the cohesion and separation of clusters.

Key Metrics
Customer Retention
Customer retention measures the ability of a business to retain customers over time. By analyzing repeat purchase behavior within clusters, businesses can identify loyal customer segments and develop targeted retention strategies.

Average Order Value (AOV)
AOV represents the average monetary value of customer orders. Calculating AOV for each cluster helps in understanding the spending patterns of different customer segments, enabling businesses to implement personalized pricing and promotion strategies.

Sales Performance
Analyzing sales performance across clusters provides insights into which customer segments contribute most to revenue. This information is vital for resource allocation and strategic planning.

Interactive Visualizations
Interactive dashboards are developed to visualize key metrics and cluster characteristics. These visualizations facilitate:

Cluster Distribution: Understanding the size and composition of each customer segment.

Metric Comparison: Comparing retention rates, AOV, and sales performance across clusters.

Trend Analysis: Monitoring changes in customer behavior over time.

Tools such as Hex can be utilized to create these interactive visualizations, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Results and Insights
The clustering analysis reveals distinct customer segments with unique purchasing behaviors. For example, one cluster may represent high-frequency, high-value customers, while another comprises infrequent, low-value shoppers. These insights allow businesses to tailor marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

Conclusion
By implementing K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, e-commerce businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior. This approach enables the development of targeted strategies to enhance customer retention, optimize pricing, and boost sales performance. Interactive visualizations further aid in comprehending complex data, facilitating informed decision-making.
